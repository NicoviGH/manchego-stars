# Handoff — Content track 🔒 live state

Per-track live state for the **content lane** (Ch2+ slices, dialogue, art). Worktree doctrine,
ownership map, and trunk rules → `CLAUDE.md` §Tracks (read first; the lane guard is
`check.py check_lane_ownership`). Parallel-work + seam model → `docs/decisions.md` §Seam enforcement /
§Seam refinement. Backlog → GitHub issues (#49 ① Content). **Shared builds/gotchas/rules → `HANDOFF.md`
+ `CLAUDE.md`; this file holds only my current state + content-lane-specific gotchas.** Don't touch
`HANDOFF-pipeline.md`.

## Base state (clean — start here)
- **`inst/content` = `b0576f1`**, ahead of `main` (`f12643d`) by 3 commits (reward-budget ADR, design-lock
  handoff, **the ch02 reground**); fast-forwardable — merge down to `main` + push.
- **`make` green** as of the reground build (`b0576f1`), `verify_text` 0 runaway (3404 msgs), drift clean,
  `difficulty.py --chapter ch02` PARITY, `check.py` clean. Working tree clean except the `fireemblem8u`
  submodule pointer (build artifact — **never commit it**).
- **This session = ch02 REGROUND, built green.** The locked design (§1) is now implemented: vanilla-Ch2
  enemy parity (chardalyn berserkers), 3 GREEN chwinga protect layer with the per-unit soft-fail
  charm-gift mechanic (`CHECK_ALIVE` → `GIVEITEMTO` at the ending scene), sled + invented chest dropped.
  ADR extended in `decisions.md` §"Ch2 hosting". **Remaining for ch02 = the human checkpoints (§1 below).**
- **A LATER, PARALLEL session (battle animations, #65) advanced HEAD to `bbc6f78`** — the Milestone-A
  *tiler core* + tests, on top of the ch02 reground; `make test` green, drift clean. **Independent of ch02's
  checkpoints** — see the Battle animations section under Now/Next. (So `inst/content` is now ~5 ahead of
  `main`; the ch02 reground is still the substantive content to merge down.)

## Decisions locked this session (all recorded in the repo — don't re-derive)
- **Recruit budget** (`decisions.md` §"Recruit budget"): roster tracks vanilla's field-growth curve to a
  **~16–18 pool**, NOT capped at Ch5. `deploy_limit` = vanilla field per chapter; recruits fill role gaps.
  Killed the stale roadmap "stops at Ch5" line.
- **Reward/item budget** (`decisions.md` §"Reward/item budget" + `fe8-pacing-reference.md §3`, now a
  [decomp]-pinned per-chapter curve): a chapter's loot mirrors its `parity_reference` (channel + tier).
  Caps: no boosters/promo before parity ≥ FE8 **Ch5**; no Silver before **Ch8**; no Master Seal / Secret
  Shop / Sacred before **~Ch14a**. Placement follows the parity_reference, not our chapter number.
- **Chapter status** (`check.py check_chapter_status`): every chapter YAML carries `status: active|planned`;
  planned = brainstorm seed (tooling skips them in the curve/gate). ch00–02 active, ch03–08 planned.
- **ch02 map is a FAITHFUL reskin** of FE8 Ch2 (terrain diff vs `Ch2Map` = **2/225** cells). Vanilla Ch2's
  literal unit tiles ARE valid in-game — author against the committed **`.mar`** (the `map-review/*-layout.json`
  is stale, disagrees ~5 cells). (Corrects an earlier wrong "walkability diverged" note.)

## Now / Next (priority order)

### 🎨 Battle animations — faked static-frame anims (#65) — Milestone A IN PROGRESS
**Spec = epic #65 (read it first: architecture, beats, milestones).** Goal: any non-vanilla-class unit gets a
custom battle anim from **1–3 static frames + the engine's existing effects** — no hand-drawn motion. RBG (a
gunslinger; **Archer is purely the parity/anim donor** — gun↔arrow dissonance is parked) is the M-A bootstrap.
- **Approach (locked, additive "donor-prime"):** APPEND a new `banim_data[]` entry cloned from a donor class
  (RBG → vanilla Archer `arcm_ar1`), swapping art only — never consume a class. Beats = **Ready / Wind-up /
  Action-peak**; the 13 modes reuse them (stand=frame0; attack/dodge/miss=`0→1→2→1`, hit fires on the peak).
- **Format mapped (decomp-grounded), per entry:** `graphics/banim/banim_<n>_sheet_*.4bpp(.lz)` +
  `banim_<n>.agbpal(.lz)` + `data/banim/banim_<n>_motion.s` (→ `oam_l`/`oam_r`/`.data.script`/`modes` via objcopy)
  + a block in `linker_script_banim.txt` + a row in `src/banim_data.c`. A class picks its anim via
  `ClassData.pBattleAnimDef`→`GetBattleAnimationId`→animId. Script cmds (`include/banim_code.inc`):
  `banim_code_frame dur,sheet,frame,oam` + `banim_code_hit_normal` + `banim_code_call_spell_anim` (fires the
  projectile). OAM frame = `banim_frame_oam attr0,attr1,attr2,dx,dy` lists. NOTE: banim assets are NOT rebuilt
  from a PNG like portraits — they're linked from the `.s` + sheets by `scripts/arm_compressing_linker.py`.
- **DONE (tiler core):** `tools/ref_to_battleframe.py` `tile_sprite` (sprite→8×8 OBJ tiles + OAM entries,
  byte-identical tiles deduped), TDD'd green. Committed `bbc6f78`.
- **DONE (slice 1 — OBJ-shape merge):** `merge_objects(filled, cols, rows)` greedily packs filled 8×8 cells
  into the fewest **legal square** GBA OBJs (4×4/2×2/1×1 cells = 32×32/16×16/8×8 px), largest-first,
  row-major, **never covering an empty cell** (no garbage tiles). 4 new TDD'd asserts in `make test` (now 7).
  Reduction verified on a humanoid-ish 64×64 silhouette: 32 cells → 5 OBJs, exact coverage. **Square-only for
  now** — wide/tall shapes (2×1, 1×2, 4×2…) + bounded-waste merges are a noted follow-up if 16 isn't hit on
  RBG. OAM encoding mapped from the decomp: `banim_frame_oam attr0,attr1,attr2,dx,dy` — attr0 bits14-15 = shape
  (0=square/0x4000=wide/0x8000=tall), attr1 bits14-15 = size + bit12/13 = h/v-flip (oam_l flips the right-facing
  base), attr2 = tile|palbank, dx/dy = pixel offset.
- **RBG art — quality LOCKED, NOT yet in repo:** 3 transparent PNGs at `…/Battle Anims/RBG Battle/{RBGReady,
  RBGwindup,RBGAction}.png` (1920×1080, left-facing). **Shared 14-colour palette** (2 ea yellow/purple/green/
  brown/pink + 2 outline-black + gun-gray + highlight; **pink protected** — it kept getting median-cut away).
  Flattened/keyed previews live in that folder's `cleaned/`. TODO: bring the 3 frames into the repo + author a
  `battle_anim:` YAML block on RBG.
- **Finding:** RBG@64×64 → **47 OBJ cells** (8×8-only) — too many; vanilla covers a battle sprite in ~16 via
  larger OBJ shapes. Slice 1's square-merge addresses this (verify the real RBG count once art is in repo).
- **DONE (slice 2 — sheet + palette emit):** `agbpal_bytes(palette)` → the 128-byte `.agbpal` (4×16 BGR555,
  our 16-col bank mirrored across all 4 sub-pals; `hword = (b>>3)<<10|(g>>3)<<5|(r>>3)`); `build_sheet_png(
  tiles, palette, tiles_per_row=32)` → indexed mode-"P" sheet PNG (row-major tile grid, transparent→index 0).
  The build does `%.4bpp: %.png` via gbagfx, so we emit the PNG, not the 4bpp. 7 new TDD'd asserts (now 14 in
  `make test`). Donor `.agbpal` format confirmed (128 B = 64 BGR555 hwords; sheet PNG = mode P, 16-entry pal,
  256px wide = 32 tiles/row).
- **DONE (slice 3a — OBJ→OAM/tile bridge):** `square_obj_attrs(w)` (cell-side→attr0 shape/attr1 size),
  `pack_frame_oam(objs, center_px)` (merged OBJs → oam_r entries + parallel sheet placements), `mirror_oam`
  (oam_r→oam_l: set h-flip bit + mirror dx). 5 new TDD'd asserts (now **19** in `make test`).
- **⚠️ KEY FORMAT FINDING (corrects the slice plan):** FE8 banim sheets are **2D char-mapped, stride 32** —
  a w×h-cell OBJ at sheet (col,row) has base tile `row*32+col` and spans a *contiguous 2D rectangle* (16×16 at
  tile N → N, N+1, N+32, N+33; the donor's body OBJs step by 0x20 vertically). So an OBJ's tile index must
  address a 2D block, NOT a position in a flat deduped tile list. **Consequence:** slice-2's `build_sheet_png`
  (flat row-major list) is only correct for the all-8×8 case; the merged case needs an **OBJ-aware** sheet
  builder that blits each OBJ's pixels at its `pack_frame_oam` placement (`build_sheet_from_placements`, in 3b).
  `agbpal_bytes` is unaffected (correct). `pack_frame_oam` already emits the right 2D `attr2` + placements.
- **DONE (slice 3b — sheet builder + motion.s gen + driver):** `build_sheet_from_placements` (blit each OBJ's
  pixels to its 2D placement on a 256-wide sheet), `emit_motion_s(abbr, frames)` (full .s text: oam_l/oam_r +
  12-mode script on the ranged 3-beat template `start_attack_1/2`→draw 0→1(held 18)→2→`call_spell_anim`→
  `wait_hp_deplete`→recover, + 24-word modes table), `build_battle_anim(abbr, frame_imgs, palette)` driver
  (tile→merge→pack→sheet per frame on ONE shared anchor → {sheets, pal, motion_s}). 10 new TDD'd asserts (now
  **29** in `make test`). Smoke-tested on the real descaled RBG frames: 14-col pal, 3 sheets, 21/14/20 OBJ/frame.
- **RBG art IS IN the repo (descaled, Nicolas OK'd provisionally 2026-06-23):** `battle_anims/prof-rbg/{ready,
  windup,peak}.png` — 88×64, common feet-anchor, snapped to the shared 15-col `_fam` palette (the `flat15`
  variants do NOT share a palette — 42-col union; use `_fam`). Uncommitted pending the in-context look.
- **⚠️ ENGINE FINDING (slice 4 route):** the live battle path (`banim-ekrbattleintro.c:1006`) calls plain
  `GetBattleAnimationId` (class-based via `pClassData->pBattleAnimDef`), NOT `_WithUnique`. The per-character
  unique path (`CharacterData._u25` → `gUnitSpecificBanimConfigs`) is **FE7-leftover, only wired to the triangle
  forecast** — it will NOT drive the real battle anim. So M-A follows the locked design: a **stat-identical
  Archer-clone class** (copy `CLASS_ARCHER` ClassData, repoint its `pBattleAnimDef` at the new animId) assigned
  to RBG. banim_data row format: `{"rbg_ar1", &…_modes_bin, &…_motion_o, &…_oam_r_bin, &…_oam_l_bin, &…_agbpal}`;
  table self-sizes via `banim_number`. linker block: 3×`_sheet_N.4bpp.lz`, `.agbpal.lz`, `oam_l/_r.bin.lz`,
  `_motion.o|.data.script>lz`, `_modes.bin`.
- **Next M-A slices (TDD each):** ~~(1) OBJ-shape merge~~ ✅; ~~(2) palette + flat sheet emit~~ ✅;
  ~~(3a) OBJ→OAM/tile bridge~~ ✅; ~~(3b) sheet builder + motion.s gen + driver~~ ✅; ~~(4) `build_campaign`
  injection + `battle_anim:` YAML~~ ✅ — **ROM BUILDS GREEN with RBG's custom anim injected** (`make` green,
  `make test` 29+15, `verify_text` 0 runaway). `inject_battle_anims` (build_campaign.py): per unit with a
  `battle_anim:` block, generate assets → write `data/banim/banim_<abbr>_motion.s` + `graphics/banim/
  banim_<abbr>_sheet_{0,1,2}.png` + `.agbpal`, append the linker block + a `banim_data[]` row (→ **animId
  0xC9**, donor rows byte-unchanged) + pointer externs, and repoint the donor class's AnimConf weapon entry.
  Pure helpers `banim_append_row`/`banim_repoint_conf` TDD'd in test_build_campaign.py. The 4 patched decomp
  files are in `PATCHED_DECOMP_FILES` (restore→re-inject each build = idempotent). RBG's YAML carries the
  `battle_anim:` block (clone_from archer, frames ready/windup/peak). **M-A = "frame-swap of the Archer"**: I
  repoint `CLASS_ARCHER`'s bow AnimConf (`AnimConf_088AF150`, archer-exclusive) → so RBG AND the ch02 enemy
  archer fire with RBG's art. Per-unit isolation (Archer-clone class so generic enemy archers stay vanilla) is
  the M-A→M-B boundary, deferred. (5) **REMAINING: capture the battle on-screen** (pipeline-lane playtest
  scenario + `make_gif.py`) → deliver the GIF to Nicolas (he's away — email/Drive). ADR for the faking approach
  lands with this. The capture needs an archer bow-attack with anims ON; the only checkpoint is `seize` (ch01),
  and whether RBG is among ch01's 4 deployed is prep-dependent — simplest sure target is the ch02 enemy archer
  (no ch02 ckpt yet) or forcing a blue unit→archer in the seize state. NOTE: a `battle_anim:` block on
  `motion.s` text assembly — emit the 3-beat oam_l/oam_r frames (Ready/Wind-up/Peak) from `pack_frame_oam`/
  `mirror_oam`, and a script/modes table cloning the archer's **ranged** attack cadence. ⚠️ **Use the FULL
  `arcm_ar1` `mode_attack_range` as the template** (`start_attack_1/2` → draw frames → `sound_pull_bow` →
  `call_spell_anim` (the arrow) → `wait_hp_deplete` → `end_mode`); the `arcm_ar1_2` variant has **no
  `call_spell_anim`** (it just holds frame 0 — no projectile). Collapse the donor's ~17 draw frames onto our 3
  beats: stand=frame0; attack/dodge/miss = 0→1(held longest)→2(+`call_spell_anim` on the peak)→1→0. modes
  table = 12 mode-offset words + zero padding (model the section layout on `arcm_ar1_2`, which is the clean
  3-frame skeleton even though its attack lacks the spell). (4) `build_campaign` append-injection (`banim_data` row +
  `linker_script_banim.txt` block + RBG class repoint, donor row byte-unchanged); (5) lock art into repo +
  build ROM + force a battle + capture (playtest harness + `make_gif.py`) → show Nicolas. **ADR for the whole
  faking approach lands with the on-screen slice (5).**
- **Lane:** authoring/injection = content; the battle-capture verification scenario = pipeline. `tools/
  ref_to_battleframe.py` is currently SHARED (registering it in `check.py`'s CONTENT_EXCLUSIVE needs a
  pipeline-lane edit — deferred).
- **Speed-up (teed up, not done):** the *build* is a sequential TDD chain — keep it on one instance. But three
  independent decomp-research unknowns can be fanned out to **parallel `Explore` subagents** first: (1) the OAM
  `attr0/attr1/attr2` bit encoding behind `banim_frame_oam`; (2) the donor `arcm_ar1` `motion.s` full 13-mode/
  script structure to clone (timing + `hit`/`call_spell_anim` placement); (3) the 4bpp + `.agbpal` + linker
  registration mechanics (`linker_script_banim.txt` + `banim_data[]` ordering). Run those concurrently to start
  research-complete, then implement serially.

### 1. 🎯 ch02 "Cold Welcome" (#22) — TACTICAL REGROUND DONE (`b0576f1`); 3 human checkpoints remain
The enemy/chwinga/gift/mechanic reground is **built green** (`inject_ch02` rewritten: parity enemies,
GREEN chwinga table `088B4718`, per-survivor `CHECK_ALIVE`→`GIVEITEMTO` gifts, reinforcements →`088B4758`,
sled dropped). What's LEFT before ch02 is "done":
- **(a) Dialogue reground — Nicolas co-write via `dialogue-pass`.** The LOCKED 2026-06-19 cutscene text
  still frames the dropped sled (Wolfram's rear-bark "…the sled"; ending narration "…ringing the sled")
  and calls the reinforcements "Snow Wolves", and the opening lacks a chwinga intro beat (a Marty line —
  the befriend-creatures diplomat). Wired as placeholder meanwhile; YAML has a PENDING block marking the
  three edits. Changing the opening beat count touches `CH02_OPENING_MSGS`.
- **(b) Chwinga + Vellynne art (#38/#39, #19).** Map-sprite reskin + portraits + name-text
  (Mote/Rime/Glimmer) over the DARA/KLIMT/MANSEL placeholder slots; Vellynne's cutscene bust. **Show
  Nicolas before commit** (no art committed without sign-off).
- **(c) mGBA load-test** ch01→ch02→win→chains; verify the chwinga LOAD green, the archer threatens the
  pegasi, and surviving chwinga deliver their charms at the ending.

The original locked-design spec is preserved below for reference (now implemented):

**A. Enemies → vanilla FE8 Ch2 "The Protected" parity (exact mix + tiles), reskinned as chardalyn berserkers.**
- Use vanilla Ch2's ACTUAL UnitDef positions + levels (from `git -C fireemblem8u show HEAD:src/events_udefs.c`
  tables `088B4344` enemies + `088B44AC` Bazba): ~6 Brigand (Iron Axe, **L1**, one drops a Vulnerary) + 1
  Archer (Iron Bow, L1) + **Bone** (named Brigand **L4**) + **Bazba** (Steel Axe). NOT my old L3 / defend-east
  placement.
- **Flavor = chardalyn berserkers** — Auril-maddened humans (physical axe/bow, **zero reskin stretch**, ties
  to ch02's frost-druid/Auril plot; book: Wilderness Encounters #7, p107). Boss **Halvar** → Bazba slot;
  miniboss **Grukk** → Bone slot.
- Re-verify `python3 tools/difficulty.py --chapter ch02` lands PARITY *with the chwinga green help counted*
  (see B) — vanilla enemies + 3 peg-chwinga ≈ vanilla Ch2 (5 + Ross/Garcia). If it sags, the chwinga are the
  swing factor, not enemy-level inflation.

**B. Protected → 3 GREEN Pegasus chwinga (DROP the sled entirely).**
- Chwinga = the vulnerable green allies you protect (mirrors vanilla's Ross/Garcia, who are green). Book:
  "Starting Quest: Nature Spirits" (p25–26) — harmless gift-giving snow-spirits; we arm them so they defend
  themselves (like Ross/Garcia, who aren't defenseless).
- **Chassis = `CLASS_PEGASUS_KNIGHT`** (verified balance match): 3 pegs ≈ Ross+Garcia in output (9–11 vs 12)
  & survivability; **Mage over-shoots** (magic hits Res≈0 on brigands) and **Myrmidon wildly over** (sword>axe
  + doubling = 3.5× output). The ch02 **archer hard-counters fliers** (iron-bow ×3) → that's the protect tension.
- **Green table:** repurpose vanilla Ch3's Colm green table (`UnitDef_088B4718`, already FACTION_GREEN) for the
  chwinga; the old build used it for RED reinforcements — reassign (fold any kept reinforcement into the RED
  `088B463C`, or drop the turn-3 wave). Cautious green AI (defend, don't suicide). `fe_name` ≤12.
- **NEW mechanic:** green protected allies + per-unit soft-fail. A chwinga that dies forfeits *its* charm only
  (set a flag on death, checked at chapter end) — not a game over. This is the chapter's signature beat.
- **Art (checkpoint, #38/#39):** tiny-spirit reskin over the Pegasus chassis — show Nicolas before commit.

**C. Charms/gifts → the exact vanilla Ch2 village loot, 1:1 with the chwinga.**
- Each SURVIVING chwinga gifts one of: **Red Gem `0x76` / Elixir `0x6D` / Pure Water `0x6E`** (vanilla Ch2's
  three village gifts). Deliver at chapter end gated on the per-chwinga survival flag. In-budget by the
  Reward ADR (ch02 parity = FE8 Ch2 = gems + premium consumables; **no boosters/promos**).

**D. Keep / drop / dialogue.**
- KEEP: `deploy_limit` 5, party persists, **Baxby's cutscene join unchanged** (do NOT rewrite it), DefeatAll,
  lord auto-deploy, the 3 locked cutscenes. NO Talk-recruit in ch02 (Baxby = the recruit; Talk planned elsewhere).
- DROP: the sled (and its soft-fail/chest-forfeit framing) and my hand-placed positions.
- **Dialogue (invoke `dialogue-pass` skill):** the locked cutscenes don't mention the chwinga — they need a
  small intro beat (why they're on the road / the party shielding them; a Marty line fits — he's the
  befriend-creatures diplomat). Co-write per the skill; ground in `lore/marty.md`.
- **Gates:** `make` green · `verify_text` 0 · `difficulty.py --chapter ch02` PARITY · mGBA load-test (ch01→ch02
  →win→chains) · art sign-off (chwinga + Vellynne #19). ADR the locked design in `decisions.md` (extend
  §"Ch2 hosting") in the SAME commit (no separate spec doc — `feedback_no_spec_docs`).

### 2. 🅿️ #46 lord-select reskin — DESIGN LOCKED, PARKED (needs Nicolas at his computer for the render sign-off)
This is the deferred UI work ("pick up the lord ux when home"). Build = clone/adapt `prep_unitselect.c` →
**`engine/lord_select_screen.c`** (dedicated screen; real prep untouched), driven by build-generated
`gLordSelectCandidates[]` + a parallel pitch-msg table (portrait+name from each pid's `CharacterData`). Pitch
panel replaces the inventory panel (qualitative, no stats); Up/Down live-refresh; A → "Will N lead?" [Yes/No]
→ sets `LORDSEL_FLAG_BASE + i`. (a)-explainer once before (locked text in issue #46). Writable buffers →
`EWRAM_OVERLAY(0)`. Custom flair (distinct frame/title/tint) is in DoD, build-then-flair.
- **Reusable:** pitches committed in `pcs/*.yaml` (`lord_pitch:`, inert until wired); dead msg-ids — pitches
  `0x929–0x92F,0x932`, explainer `0x957` (`0x965–0x96E` are LIVE); `recordlord` exists in `harness.lua`
  (`PT_FPS=240 tools/playtest/run.sh recordlord` → `make_gif.py`). Gate: mGBA render → Nicolas sign-off;
  commit `Closes #46`+`Closes #21`; ADR already in `decisions.md` §Lord-select UI.

### 3. Supporting content / art
Vellynne portrait #19 · ch02 title card (gen_chapter_title atlas lacks C/W/d/m — VISUAL, sign-off) · enemy
YAML pass #18 · NPC/recruit stubs #17 · world-map unlock #29 · overworld sprites #38 · onboarding-parity #64.

## Watch out (content-lane only)
- **msg-id vetting is treacherous:** `data_battlequotes.c` stores ids 4-digit zero-padded (`0x0935`); naïve
  hex-grep gives false negatives. Vet by **content** + check `data_battlequotes.c` in the `0x0XXX` form. (ch02
  used dead Ch3-scene ids `0x98b–0x99a`, excluding the LIVE `0x993`/`0x994`.)
- **Writing any dialogue → invoke the `dialogue-pass` skill first.** Voice grounding: per-NPC `lore/*.md` §Voice
  + `lore/frostmaiden-voices.md` + `fireemblem8u/texts/texts.txt`. Read sources first; bring drafts.
- **DM notes are a baseline, not a cage** — invented content (e.g. ch02's combat; the canonical Targos leg has
  none) is legit; say canon-vs-invented, don't treat "not in the notes" as wrong. Story sources of truth:
  `References/DungeonMasterNotesIcewindDale.pdf` + the Frostmaiden book PDF (image-only; read pages via the
  Read tool's `pages`).
- **Reward placement follows `parity_reference`, not chapter number** (Reward ADR). Our MVP (parity ≤ Ch13) is
  below the Master-Seal/Secret-Shop line → promotions stay deferred to Revel's End.
- Long unit names overflow FE8's name buffer — add a short `fe_name` (≤12) to new units.
- Story bodies are `make`-regenerated; gate text changes with `python3 tools/verify_text.py`.
- **Chapter hosting (model on `inject_ch01`/`inject_ch02`):** each chapter rides the *next* vanilla slot
  (ch01→2; ch02→**3**); chains via `MNC2(<next slot>)`; an unhosted next chapter dead-ends on
  `dev_placeholder_scene`. ch02 is party-persist (no cast re-LOAD), DefeatAll (slot-4 goal donor), lord
  auto-force-deployed (flag hook — nothing per-chapter).
- **The repo moves under you:** parallel pipeline work lands on `main`. Re-check `git log main` and sync before
  a big build.
