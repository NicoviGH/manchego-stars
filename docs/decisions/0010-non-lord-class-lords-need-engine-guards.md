# Non-LORD-class lords need engine guards (the prologue "garbage-band" crash).

Our cast ride ordinary vanilla character slots (`PORTRAIT_MAP`); none are FE8 LORD-class. FE8's chapter start assumes the player *leader* is a deployed LORD-class unit, and that assumption, violated, crashed the prologue. The failure chain (debugger-confirmed, not guessed):
1. `bmcamadjust.c:GetPlayerStartCursorPosition` centers the cursor on `GetUnitFromCharId(GetPlayerLeaderPid())`. With no LORD deployed that returns **NULL**, and the vanilla code dereferences it (`unit->xPos`) → reads BIOS garbage → cursor parked **off-map** (e.g. y=32 on a 10-tall map).
2. The terrain-display window then reads `gBmMapTerrain[cursor.y][cursor.x]` out of bounds → a garbage terrain id (e.g. 330).
3. `bmmap.c:GetTerrainName` indexes its 65-entry name table with that id → a garbage `gMsgTable[]` pointer → the **Huffman text decoder runs away** (same decoder-runaway class as the terminator-parity gotcha above), spewing `0x73 0x20` across IWRAM and overrunning `gBmSt` (camera/cursor/render state) → corrupted tiles ("garbage band") + soft-lock, and eventually a wild jump (`Jumped to invalid address`).
The map data, tileset, dimensions, and pointers were all **correct** — a runtime NULL-deref, not a build/asset defect. Two campaign-agnostic guards in `build_campaign.py` (applied every build; the build fails if the decomp source form drifts via each patch's `if orig not in text`, and `tools/check.py:check_engine_guards_present` fails if they're removed):
- `_patch_player_start_cursor_guard` — `GetPlayerStartCursorPosition` falls back to the first valid player unit when the leader isn't deployed, and never derefs NULL (the real fix).
- `_patch_terrain_name_guard` — `GetTerrainName` clamps out-of-range terrain ids to 0 (defensive; an invalid terrain must render, never crash).

Method that cracked it after env-gated bisection went nowhere: **`mGBA -g` + `arm-none-eabi-gdb`** (`brew install arm-none-eabi-gdb`); a **hardware watchpoint** on `gBmSt.playerCursor.y` caught the exact write sequence (CAMERA set it on the lord → `ProcFun_ResetCursorPosition` reset it off-map → decoder runaway). Symbols live in `fireemblem8u/fireemblem8.elf`. For map/render corruption, reach for the watchpoint early.
