# Growths + starting weapon ranks: copied from a class-matched vanilla "stat donor" unit

"Do what the actual game does" — rather than invent growths, each cast unit takes the personal
growths and base weapon ranks of a canonical FE8 unit of the same class, so it levels and fights
like a real FE unit of that class. Donors (`STAT_DONOR` in `tools/build_campaign.py`): Shaman→Knoll,
Mage→Lute, Archer→Neimi, Armor Knight→Gilliam, Priest→Moulder, Pegasus Knight→Vanessa, Pirate→Garcia
(no PC pirate exists in FE8; the axe-fighter is the proxy). Base stats stay the pure class baseline
(personal base deltas 0). Donor data is read from a pre-patch vanilla snapshot so it's correct even
when a donor is itself a portrait slot we repurpose. Per-unit growth/rank tuning, if ever wanted, is
a later balance pass.
_Decided: 2026-06-04 (replaces the earlier zeroed-growths / flat-E-rank placeholder)_

**This does NOT mean stripping vanilla FE8 *class features*.** A stock class keeps its built-in
kit — Berserker crit, Bishop's bonus vs monsters, **Summoner's Summon command (CA_SUMMON)**,
Canto, flight, etc. We dropped the homebrew D&D ability layer, not FE mechanics.
