## Engine & Tech Stack

**Base game: FE8 Sacred Stones (US) decomp (`fireemblem8u`)**
Using the near-complete matching decompilation from FireEmblemUniverse. The deliverable is a `.gba` file — no custom engine, no SRPG Studio, no Lex Talionis.
_Decided: May 2026_

**Compiler: agbcc (GCC 2.95.1)**
The decomp uses the original GBA compiler to produce byte-identical output. New engine modules also use agbcc. No C99 features, no VLAs, no designated initializers.
_Decided: May 2026_

**Engine/content split: engine in C (reusable), campaign data in YAML (swappable)**
All campaign-specific data (character names, chapter events, unit stats, maps, dialogue) lives in `campaigns/rime-of-the-frostmaiden/` and is injected at build time. Engine C code must be campaign-agnostic. A second campaign requires only a new `campaigns/` folder.
_Decided: May 2026_

## Combat System

> **2026-05-28 — Combat resolution reverted to vanilla FE.** The earlier "Hybrid
> d20/FE" decision (May 2026) is **superseded**. For playability the combat *rules*
> stay vanilla FE8 (hit%/avoid/might, FE crit, FE doubling); **D&D is flavor only**.
> The d20 survives at most as a **cosmetic flourish on a crit**, never as the
> resolution system. **AC, saving throws, and advantage/disadvantage are dropped**
> as mechanics (see below). Rationale (Nicolas): "the rules need to stay FE or the
> game won't play the same" — the FE-strictness spine. The four implementation
> sub-questions were ratified by Nicolas on 2026-05-28: d20 = cosmetic-crit-only,
> saves dropped, AC dropped, advantage dropped.

**Combat resolution: vanilla FE8 hit / avoid / might**
Hit, avoid, might, and crit are computed exactly as vanilla FE8 (`bmbattle.c`,
left intact). No d20 attack roll; no Armor Class. The D&D reskins below are
flavor/UI only and never change the math.
_Decided: 2026-05-28 (supersedes the May 2026 hybrid-d20 decision)_

**d20: cosmetic crit flourish only**
When an FE crit fires, the battle UI may play a brief "d20 lands on 20" flourish
for D&D feel. It does not gate or alter the hit — resolution is pure FE. This is
the only place the die appears.
_Decided: 2026-05-28_

**AC (Armor Class): dropped as a mechanic**
Defense is FE's `DEF` (vs physical) and `RES` (vs magic), plus speed/luck/terrain
avoid — exactly as vanilla FE. There is no separate to-hit target. The `ac:` source
values and `d20_fields` blocks in the PC YAMLs are retained only as
flavor/source-of-record; nothing in resolution reads them.
_Decided: 2026-05-28_

**Saving throws: dropped → vanilla FE magic**
No DCs, no save rolls. Status staves (Sleep/Silence/Berserk/Poison) always-hit per
vanilla FE; offensive spells resolve through FE magic combat (MAG vs RES, FE
hit/avoid). The `save:` / `save_dc:` fields throughout the PC YAMLs are flavor only.
_Decided: 2026-05-28_

**Advantage / disadvantage: dropped**
No advantage concept. Positioning matters through standard FE terrain bonuses and
the weapon triangle only.
_Decided: 2026-05-28_

**Damage: vanilla FE armor-subtraction model (nothing layered under it)**
`Damage = Might − Defender.DEF/RES`, where Might = the FE weapon/tome's Might + the unit's STR
(physical) or MAG (magic) — all FE-native. Weapons are FE items; their Might comes from the FE
weapon tier (Iron/Steel/Silver…), **not** from a 5e die or any conversion. No weapon dice, no
ability modifier, no D&D multiplier (see the damage-type decision below). Do NOT import 5e HP/damage
values — FE stats and growth tables (HP caps ~60–80) are authored directly.
_Decided: 2026-05-28; sharpened 2026-05-29 (FE stats/Might only — no 5e die-to-might conversion)_

**Critical hits: vanilla FE (skill-based rate, ×3 damage)**
FE's native crit — crit rate from SKL/weapon, triple damage. The earlier "roll
weapon dice twice on nat 20" is dropped with the d20 resolution. Killer/high-crit
units use vanilla FE crit-rate bonuses.
_Decided: 2026-05-28 (supersedes the May 2026 roll-twice crit)_

**Doubling: vanilla FE (unchanged)**
`AttackSpeed_attacker − AttackSpeed_defender ≥ 4` → attacker attacks twice.
_Decided: May 2026 (still current)_

**Damage-type resistance/vulnerability/immunity: DROPPED as a mechanic**
The 13-damage-type resistance multiplier (×0.5 / ×2 / ×0) has **no vanilla FE analogue**
and would modify FE damage under the hood — exactly the kind of D&D bolt-on we're avoiding
(Nicolas, 2026-05-28: "that's not part of the FE combat system… it should not conflict with
vanilla FE under the hood"). So:
- **Damage types are flavor labels only** — a weapon/tome carries a D&D damage-type name + icon
  for descriptions and UI. No resistance/vuln/immunity computation runs in damage resolution.
- **Iconic matchups use vanilla FE weapon effectiveness.** FE8 already has effective weapons
  (Hammer vs armor, Wyrmslayer vs dragons, etc.). When a vulnerability genuinely matters to
  play — e.g. "fire melts ice trolls" — flag the relevant weapon **effective** vs that enemy
  class. That's vanilla-FE-native, not a new multiplier. Use sparingly; most damage types stay
  pure flavor.
- **No `resistance_table.c` / resistance bitmap.** The `engine/damage-types/` module reduces to
  a flavor-label tag (for UI) — no resistance engine.
_Decided: 2026-05-28 (supersedes the May 2026 "13 damage types with resistance per class")_

**Hit-rate tuning: vanilla FE, no special floor needed**
With vanilla FE hit/avoid restored, FE8's native 70–95% hit norms apply directly —
the old d20-variance problem and the "skill floor" mitigation are moot. Tune
per-chapter via enemy stats/terrain as in any FE hack.
_Decided: 2026-05-28 (supersedes Option A d20 hit-rate tuning)_

---

## Weapon & Magic Systems

**Weapon triangle: vanilla FE (Sword > Axe > Lance); damage-type names are flavor**
The triangle is FE-native and driven by weapon TYPE (`src/bmbattle.c sWeaponTriangleRules`):
Sword > Axe > Lance > Sword, +1 ATK / +15 hit. D&D damage-type names (slashing,
bludgeoning, piercing, …) are **cosmetic per-weapon labels** shown in the item info — NOT
a relabeling of the triangle. A "claw" wolf and an axe bandit are both the **axe type** and
read identically on the triangle; the difference is sprite + label only.
_Decided: 2026-05-29 (supersedes the May 2026 "reskin the triangle to Slashing/Bludgeoning/Piercing," which conflicted with FE weapon types)_

**Magic triangle: vanilla FE (Anima > Light > Dark)**
FE-native: Anima > Light > Dark > Anima, +1 ATK / +15 hit (`sWeaponTriangleRules`). Caster
spread after the 2026-05-30 promotion fix: Rootis = Anima; Marty & Meesmickle = Dark (both
Shaman, differentiated at promotion — Marty→Druid, Meesmickle→Summoner); Light is covered by
Sclorbo (Priest→Bishop, attack tomes at promotion). Note: reclassing Marty off Light (to honor
his D&D Druid identity → FE Druid) means two Dark casters rather than one-each across the triangle.
_Decided: 2026-05-29; caster spread updated 2026-05-30_

**13 damage-type labels (flavor only — no resistance mechanic)**
Types: slashing, piercing, bludgeoning, fire, cold, lightning, thunder, poison, acid, necrotic, radiant, force, psychic. These are **flavor tags** on weapons/tomes for descriptions + UI. **No per-class resistance bitmap, no ×0.5/×2/×0 multiplier** (reverted 2026-05-28 — see Combat System §). Iconic vulnerabilities use vanilla FE weapon **effectiveness** instead.
_Decided: 2026-05-28 (supersedes the May 2026 resistance-bitmap decision)_

**Spell economy: finite-use tomes that deplete and are restocked with gold (decision B)**
Every spell is a finite-use item with FE tome/staff durability. Charges DEPLETE in use and
are **restocked with gold between chapters at a shop** — there is no free per-chapter refill.
Cantrips are high-count items (30–50 uses) rather than truly infinite. This puts casters in
the same gold/durability economy as martial weapons, preserving FE's core resource-management
layer (the whole party shops, scavenges, rations). Flavor the restock per character (forage /
scribe / pray); mechanically these are vanilla FE tomes/staves.
_Decided: 2026-05-29 (supersedes the May 2026 "free chapter-refill, cantrips infinite, slots not buyable")_

**MVP weapons = stock FE weapons (no custom Might); personal weapons are post-MVP**
PCs carry plain vanilla FE weapons whose stats (Mt/Hit/Crit/Wt/uses) come verbatim from a stock
FE8 item, named in each inventory entry's `fe_base` field — there is **no custom Might authoring**.
Conventions:
- **Physical weapons use stock names** (Iron Axe, Hand Axe, Iron Bow, Iron Lance, Javelin, Heal).
  Visual identity rides on the **sprite/portrait art** (an Iron Axe can be drawn as an anchor).
- **Tomes keep an element-right flavor NAME but are mechanically the basic stock tome** (name-only
  reskin, stock stats): Rootis "Ray of Frost" = `Fire`; Marty "Shillelagh" / Meesmickle "Eldritch
  Blast" = `Flux`; Sclorbo "Frostsong"/"Withering Impression" = `Lightning`. This avoids a stock
  tome name (e.g. "Fire") clashing with an ice/fungal caster's element.
- **Personal/signature weapons return post-MVP** as story progression, each mapped to an FE
  equivalent (e.g. Braulo's "Nu' Shipwrecker" → Killer Axe). Their flavor names are parked in
  `lore/<pc>.md` ("Signature gear").
This resolves the old "weapon Might TBD" / "uses: null TBD" placeholders.
_Decided: 2026-05-30_

## Economy

**Gold Pieces (GP) replace FE gold (same mechanic, D&D label)**
Armory = weapon shop. Vendor = item shop. FE8 world-map shop system preserved.
_Decided: May 2026_

**No arena**
FE8's arena is removed. Wolfram's Forge fills the "spend gold to get stronger" role.
_Decided: May 2026_

---

## Distribution & Scope

**Distribution: private, pre-patched ROM sent directly to 7 players**
No patch file, no RomHack Plaza listing, no public hosting. Non-SRD content (Artificer, Circle of Spores, homebrew races) can be used freely for this private distribution.
_Decided: May 2026_

**Permadeath: player choice via FE8's Casual/Classic toggle**
The toggle ships as-is from vanilla FE8. In-fiction flavor for Casual retreats: "retreated to the sled" / "carried to safety by Baxby."
_Decided: May 2026_

**MVP scope: 7 chapters, ending at the Revel's End cliffhanger**
Chapter 7 ends in a scripted defeat. Text: "You wake up on the road to Revel's End..." Credits roll. Chapters beyond the DM notes require a future writing session.
_Decided: May 2026_

---

## Art & Audio

**Maps: hand-drawn in Tiled, NOT AI-generated**
Use community Frostmaiden maps (from `docs/frostmaiden-resources.md`) as layout references. Use FEUniverse map pool for tileset/format guidance. Agents help with unit placement and events, never spatial layout.
_Decided: May 2026_

**Audio: vanilla FE8 soundtrack for MVP**
Investigate Frostmaiden Spotify album + community soundtracks as stretch-goal custom tracks post-ship.
_Decided: May 2026_

**Portraits: AI-generated base from D&D Beyond art → manual cleanup → FE pixel art conversion**
Specs: 80×72 main portrait, 32×32 mini portrait, 16-color GBA palette.
_Decided: May 2026_

**Sprites: recolored vanilla FE8 sprites, modified via Nanobanana 2 for homebrew races**
Custom sprites (Grells, Messie, ice trolls) sourced from FEUniverse community or Nanobanana 2 edits.
_Decided: May 2026_

**Cutscene art: portrait-based dialogue only for MVP**
CG-style illustrations (Braulo shackle break, Messie rising, Revel's End fade) are post-ship stretch goals.
_Decided: May 2026_

## Class Mapping & Promotions

All 7 PCs (and recruits) are **stock vanilla FE8 classes** — bases, growths, caps, MOV, CON, and
weapon ranks taken verbatim from `fireemblem8u/src/data_classes.c`. **No custom classes, no
per-character abilities.** Individuality comes from flavor text, sprite/portrait art, and palette.

**This does NOT mean stripping vanilla FE8 *class features*.** A stock class keeps its built-in
kit — Berserker crit, Bishop's bonus vs monsters, **Summoner's Summon command (CA_SUMMON)**,
Canto, flight, etc. We dropped the homebrew D&D ability layer, not FE mechanics.

**Base classes**
| PC | FE base | D&D source |
|---|---|---|
| Braulo | Pirate | Barbarian (Berserker) |
| Marty | Shaman | Druid (Circle of Spores) — FE8's Druid class is reachable only via Shaman |
| Meesmickle | Shaman | Warlock (The Fiend) |
| Prof. RBG | Archer | Artificer (Artillerist) |
| Rootis | Mage | Sorcerer (Draconic) |
| Sclorbo | Priest | Bard (College of Lore) |
| Wolfram | Knight (Armor Knight) | Metallurgist |

Marty & Meesmickle share the Shaman chassis but differentiate at **promotion**, not base.
_Decided: 2026-05-30 (supersedes the 2026-05-27 "Marty→Monk for sprite differentiation," which forced an illegal Monk→Summoner promotion)_

**Promotions are FE8's vanilla BRANCHED choice (the player picks at the Master Seal)**
Every promoting class has two vanilla options (`fireemblem8u/src/classchg-data.c`); each unit YAML
lists the `branch` + a thematic `default` (in **bold**):
- Braulo: Pirate → {Warrior, **Berserker**}
- Marty: Shaman → {**Druid**, Summoner} — Druid = his D&D class name; Summoner = the Summon command
- Meesmickle: Shaman → {Druid, **Summoner**}
- RBG: Archer → {**Sniper**, Ranger}
- Rootis: Mage → {**Sage**, Mage Knight}
- Sclorbo: Priest → {**Bishop**, Sage}
- Wolfram: Armor Knight → {**General**, Great Knight}
- Pinky (recruit): Pegasus Knight → {**Falcon Knight**, Wyvern Knight}
_Decided: 2026-05-30 (fixes the illegal Monk→Summoner and the non-existent "Dark Sage")_

**Sclorbo: stock Priest → Bishop (staff healer; attack tomes at promotion)**
A vanilla Priest — staff-only healer at base, Light attack from the Bishop promotion. He is the
MVP healer. The earlier "Lore Bishop" custom hybrid (Dancer chassis + retained Dance + per-turn
Dance-or-Cast lever + custom heal tiers) is gone: no Dancer, no Dance, no Rapier.
_Decided: 2026-05-29_

**Rootis: stock Mage → Sage / Mage Knight**
A plain anima caster (ice = flavor only). The earlier "Dragon Wings = Manakete-style class
transform" and "custom flier Sage" are gone with the ability strip — no transform, no dragon form,
no Sorcery Points. His draconic identity is sprite art + lore.
_Decided: 2026-05-29_

**Pepperjack & Brie are separate recruitable units, not RBG summons**
Two sentient automatons RBG builds; each joins the army as an ordinary FE8 recruit (`npcs/`), not a
deployable cannon/summon, and is a stock vanilla class (TBD post-MVP). Pokémon-style speech (each
only says its own name — "Pepperjack!" / "Brie!"); they're dating. Pinky (RBG's homunculus "son")
is a third recruit — the army's flier (Pegasus Knight). Combined portrait at
`data/portraits/pepperjack-and-brie.jpeg`. Full flavor in `lore/pepperjack-and-brie.md`, `lore/pinky.md`.
_Decided: 2026-05-29_

**FE stat column folds 5e stats to FE stats**
Class-mapping docs surface FE engine stats (STR/DEX/MAG/etc.) instead of 5e stats (WIS/INT/CHA). All magic-stat 5e classes (WIS Druid, INT Artificer, CHA Warlock/Sorcerer/Bard) use MAG in engine. Flavor distinctions stay in YAML metadata, not class mapping.
_Decided: 2026-05-27_

**Wolfram & RBG are NOT casters**
Both are stock physical classes with **no spell access**: Wolfram is a Lance Knight (STR), RBG a
Bow Archer (SKL/DEX). The earlier "hybrid caster" overlay (secondary MAG, finite-use cantrip
tomes) is gone. Their fire/forge and firearm/gadget flavor is sprite art + lore only.
_Decided: 2026-05-29_

## Open Questions (not yet decided)

See `docs/PRD.md §13` for the full list. Key unresolved items:
- Signature moments for Marty, Meesmickle, Rootis, Sclorbo (Nicolas to recall)
- Velynne Harpell's arc (check published adventure)
- Sephek Kaltro — did he appear in the campaign?
- Messie's specific Bremen function (shop? services? quest-giver?)
- Unit struct save budget for D&D fields (audit in Phase 1, issue #10)
