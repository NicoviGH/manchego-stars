# Handoff - Manchego Stars live state

`HANDOFF.md` is live state only: where the tree is, what is in flight, what is owed, what to do
next. **Settled decisions live in `docs/decisions.md`** — if a thing is decided, it belongs there
and gets deleted from here. Operating rules live in `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`; scope and backlog
live in GitHub issues. Before a context rollover, warn Nicolas, refresh this file, and start a
fresh instance — don't rely on auto-compaction.

Refreshed 2026-08-26 (Claude). Deep-cleaned 2026-08-20 at Nicolas's instruction: anything already
recorded in `docs/decisions.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or a GitHub issue was deleted from here rather than
restated. Check that a thing has a home before writing it here.

## In flight

**ch06 design pass (#26) — brainstorm + art scouting. No ROM built, no chapter code written.**
`main` is at **#330** (`7cc20bb`), CI green, no open PRs. One UNCOMMITTED edit: `ch06`'s YAML (see
below). Tree is otherwise clean bar the usual dirty submodule and Nicolas's untracked `.agents/`.

**The design board is the store for the chapter design:**
`https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6952f53d-0fde-4a0f-b07c-b8fc846d6f10` — canon vs seed, vanilla Ch6
examined, donor evaluation, art sourcing, and the numbered decisions. ⚠️ **It is one revision behind
on two points** (Messie's pronoun and the sprite-size ceiling); both are now written into
`chapters/ch06-the-maer-monster.yaml` instead, which is the better home anyway. The scratchpad that
held the board's source template was cleared by a session restart, so updating it means re-reading
250KB of embedded images — not worth the context. Rebuild it from the YAML when ch06 is next picked up.

**The ch06 slice has a branch now: `feat/26-ch06-the-maer-monster`, PR #331** (unreviewed). It
carries the design pass's settled content — Messie is **he/him**, and the Talk beat now names the
ch05 payoff: the book (p.31) names **Ravisin** as the druid who awakened him, and he keeps attacking
only because he fears she will take the gift back. She is dead; the awakening is permanent. That is
Marty's argument and the spine of the chapter. Everything further on ch06 goes on that branch.

## Next task

**Art first, at Nicolas's call — the PixelLab probe.** The MCP is connected now (it needed the
session restart; there is no OAuth step). ⚠️ **Do not reach it over `curl` — the auto-mode classifier
blocks the authenticated request, and that block is correct.**

⚠️ **BUDGET: it is a TRIAL — 38 of 40 generations left, $0.00 credits, paid to PixelLab (not
Anthropic; Claude tokens do not cover images).** `create_character` standard = **1** generation;
**`pro` = 20-40 per call and would eat the trial in one shot — do not use it.**
`animate_character` template = 1 per direction.

What ch06 actually needs from it, given the ceiling below: **a 32x32 side-on idle**, and — as the
real experiment — **whether it can produce a WALK CYCLE for art that is ours**. See "the gap" below.
Nicolas also wants **Akueria** (an unreleased Pokémon, a rounder front-3/4 plesiosaur with a pearl)
tested as a second base alongside the recoloured Dorrie. ⚠️ It was pasted into chat and there is no
file for it — ask him to save it (e.g. `map-review/akueria.png`) before trying; PixelLab needs a URL
or a file, and `reference_image_url` is preferred because MCP clients truncate large base64.

⚠️ **`gen_symbols.py` hardcodes `fireemblem8u/fireemblem8.elf`.** Pointing the harness at a
`.matrix-romcache` ROM from a different build reads shifted addresses and hangs at `boot stuck`
with procs that never change — which looks exactly like broken input and is not. Restore the ROM,
the ELF **and** `.build-config.json` from the same cache entry, then re-run `gen_symbols.py`.

**Tree state: the ROM in the tree is still `ch05boot`** (CH05BOOT=1). Nothing was built in this
session. `tools/playtest/states/` still holds valid **`prep`** and **`ch02start`** stamped for the
CANONICAL ROM, so anything wanting them needs canonical back in the tree first. A dead state is
exactly **397,312 bytes of zeros** — that size is the tell.

**The ROM cache is WARM** for `canonical`, `testch`, `ch03boot`, `ch04boot`, `ch05boot`,
`ch05lupinboot`, `ch05mooseboot` and the three ch05 ending arms (2026-08-24). Untouched since.

## Map sprites — read before any art session

All of it is in `docs/decisions.md` → **"A map sprite is 32x32 or it is nothing"** (lands with PR #331): the hard engine
ceiling, why size reads as FILL, why geometry is derived from the donor and never from sheet pixels,
why a decomp sheet's palette is a meaningless leftover, what `footprint:` actually means, and the
WALK-vs-GLIDE split that decides whether PixelLab is worth paying for. Do not restate it here.

## Recently landed — do not redo

DONE and merged. One line each, so a fresh session does not reopen one. **The detail is in the
named `docs/decisions.md` ADR or on the issue — deliberately not restated here.** Where no ADR is
named, the issue is the record.

**The #302 epic — playtest cost and chapter tooling. All merged:**

| | ADR in `docs/decisions.md` |
|---|---|
| #308 verdict scenarios run headless | *A verdict scenario needs no pixels, so it runs HEADLESS* |
| #309 a config switch is 25s, not 50s | *A build is 50 seconds, and 26 of them were the same battle anims every time* |
| #310 parallel dispatch + the `pkill` that sabotaged it | *A blanket `pkill` is a serial-world habit, and parallel dispatch turned it into a saboteur* |
| #311 `make scene` — a scene without a ROM | *A scene is readable without a ROM, and a press count is read off the BODY* |
| #312 `make chapter` — status is derived | *A chapter's status is DERIVED, and HANDOFF stops carrying it* |
| #313 the ChapterEventGroup census guard | *Every ChapterEventGroup field is WRITTEN or DECLARED-INHERITED* |
| #314 a chapter declares its own scenarios | *A scenario is DECLARED by the chapter it tests* |
| #327 the Lua local-slot ceiling, measured then frozen | *The headroom guard measured one file correctly BY ACCIDENT* + *A CHAPTER is not what was filling harness.lua* |
| #302 the merge gate is bounded | *The gate is the spine plus the last two chapters; depth lives in the chapter suite* |

**ch05 is complete** (#25 and children): dialogue all 17 scenes (#295), enemy reskins (#296), the
no-Lupin Talk arm (#297), all three ending arms filmed (#299), the Arena (#265/#268), the
village-raid race and save-all payout (#254), Ravisin end-to-end (#259, #261, #263, #286, #290-292),
per-chapter battle grounds (#289), the ch01/ch07 winter CGs (#256). Reskin board:
`https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6a05e1ff-8938-49ed-8927-631d0e4dc6bd`

**Also landed:** #298 dialogue wraps by PIXELS (ADR *We wrapped on-map talk at 29 CHARACTERS; the
engine measures PIXELS*) · #300/#301 `tools/callsites.py` — **use it before changing any signature,
and especially before changing what a parameter MEANS** · #303/#304 all three difficulty modes
(ADR *Vanilla ships three difficulty modes, so we ship three*) · #306 traps are declared, not
inherited · #329 a donor is derived, not labelled (ADR *A base-map LABEL is prose — the donor is
DERIVED*) · #330 the drift lint now scans `.github/` and `.claude/skills/`.

⚠️ **Not landed, and it was buried in this list as though it were:** the **encounter-choice fields**
(`playerUnits/enemyUnitsChoice{1,2,3}InEncounter`) are still inherited on ch03 and ch05 — six vanilla
skirmish rosters each, dormant only while we expose no world map. Owed on #302.

## Current state

- **Where a chapter stands is `make chapter CH=chNN`** (#312) — scenes declared vs written vs
  previewable, message-id headroom, art per named unit, which scenarios cover it and what each
  last said, and everything declared but unbuilt. `make chapter` with no `CH=` is all nine at a
  glance. **Do not write any of that into this file again**: it is derived on demand, so a
  generated answer cannot go stale and prose someone has to remember to update always does.
  Two things it says today that nobody had computed: **ch05's message block is FULL**
  (`0x9E4-0x9F5`, all 18 spent — the next ch05 scene costs a redesign, not an id), and **ch01
  declares five events and has written two.**
- **Backlog swept 2026-08-22** — do NOT re-survey it by issue title or checkbox. ch03 taught that
  an unchecked box records what someone intended, not what the repo contains: #23 read as "7 open
  items" while git history and the live YAML showed the work shipped long ago. Cross-reference the
  artifact. Closed in the sweep: #303, #23, #133, #244. Still open and each carrying its own fresh
  evidence: **#135** (real v0.1.0 playtester feedback on art consistency and difficulty, never
  triaged) and **#30** (`campaign.yaml`'s `chapters:` block omits the prologue and is off-by-one
  from ch04 on — nothing reads it, so it misleads rather than breaks). #30 is now cheap: since
  #312 there is one reader for the chapter YAML (`tools/campaign_chapters.py`), so that block
  can be derived from it rather than hand-kept.
- **Environment: Nicolas is on his Mac. ROM builds, `verify_text` and mGBA playtests are LIVE.**
- **Checkout: `/Users/Yonick/Projects/manchego-stars`, the ONE tree** (#267). It is clean except
  for the intentionally dirty `fireemblem8u` submodule and Nicolas's untracked `.agents/` +
  `AGENTS.md` — preserve those and **stage paths explicitly**.
- **Two sandbox false negatives on this Mac, neither a real failure.** `gh auth status` reports
  the saved token invalid because a restricted process cannot read the macOS Keychain — run `gh`
  with escalation rather than asking Nicolas to log in again. And an mGBA GUI crash with an AppKit
  registration abort happened BEFORE the ROM ran; escalated emulator runs are normal, so diagnose
  ROM state only once it actually boots.
- **Cross-agent continuity:** Nicolas uses Codex only between Claude sessions. Codex must leave an
  explicit HANDOFF entry naming what it changed, the branch/PR and commit state, verification
  actually run, and the exact next step. Short-lived feature branches in this checkout, one at a
  time — **no worktrees unless Nicolas says otherwise**.

## Before you touch anything

Everything below used to be spelled out here and is now in its real home. This list is the INDEX;
do not re-inline the content.

- **How to work here** (the matrix rule, the boundary rule, feature-flow, the tool table) →
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Why anything is the way it is** → `docs/decisions.md`, 55 dated entries. The ones most likely
  to bite an unfamiliar session: *"Playtest runs are the most expensive thing in this repo"*,
  *"A scenario written against the old design will FAIL ON SUCCESS"*, *"An artifact is not its
  inputs"*, *"A community map sprite is keyed on GREEN, not on index 0"*, *"The TESTCH bench is
  bounded by SMS VRAM"*, *"A battle anim carries FOUR palettes and the engine picks one"*.
- **What is left to build** → GitHub issues, #20–#28 per chapter; **#302** is the live epic.
- **Before a wide mechanical edit** → `tools/callsites.py`, then diff the OUTPUT. Three bugs
  shipped in one day from a regex sweep that all 546 tests passed through, and what caught them
  was rendering every message body under both versions and diffing (`decisions.md` → "We wrapped
  on-map talk at 29 CHARACTERS", §HOW THE ROLLOUT MUST BE GATED). Run that diff BEFORE the suite.
- **Which asset the FE-Repo has** → `docs/fe-repo-scouting.md`. ⚠️ Its table says where an anim
  LIVES, not what it does; open a candidate's mode folders before believing a gap.

Two live workflow facts that are not decisions and have nowhere better to sit:

- **After any ROM build, `make check` fails `test_difficulty` + `test_map_tileset` together.**
  That pair is the signature of reading the BUILT decomp tree. Fix, don't debug:
  `git -C fireemblem8u restore src/data/chapter_settings.json data/data_8B363C.s`.
- **`HANDOFF.md` is authored on `main` ONLY**, gated by `check.py check_handoff_only_on_main`. If
  the guard fires on a branch: `git checkout main -- HANDOFF.md`.
