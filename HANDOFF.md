> **⭐ OPEN #2 (PINKY SCOUT STAGING) — FIXED (`c57c421`, verified in-engine + Nicolas watched GIF).** Only **Pinky**
> now fades out; **RBG holds** at the mine mouth through the `STAL(90)` pause, then Pinky fades back in for "It looked
> at me." ROOT: the `Text(msg)` macro (`Convo_Helpers.h`) = `TEXTSTART TEXTSHOW TEXTEND REMA` — the trailing `REMA`
> clears ALL faces, so RBG vanished. FIX: author beat D **raw** (`TEXTSTART/TEXTSHOW/TEXTEND`, no REMA) and fade only
> Pinky via a trailing **`[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]`** in his message body (scene.c:894 `StartFaceFadeOut` on the active
> podium). RBG persists because beat E's `Text()` re-opens with `TEXTSTART` == the still-active type → `Event1A_TEXTSTART`
> **skips its face-clear** (`subcode == proc->activeTextType`, eventscr.c) and `TalkLoadFace` early-returns on the occupied
> slot (no reflicker). New reusable **`trailing`/`trailings`** hook on `_script_to_message`/`_emit_scene_beats`. ADR in
> `decisions.md` (Operational Gotchas → cutscene faces). **No event-level single-face-remove exists** — only `REMA` (all)
> and `FACE_SHOW`/`EvtDisplayFace` (add one); the per-face fade-out is a message text-code, not an opcode.
> **⭐ OPEN #1 (OPENING MAP FLASH) — RESOLVED as NOT-A-BUG (Nicolas confirmed via proof GIF).** An **every-game-frame**
> capture of the intro (`PT_SHOTEVERY=1`) shows the transition is clean: "Za'ha Woods" title card → fade → **solid black
> holds** → the Termalaine street fades up. The cave map **never appears**. The prior "map fades in for ~4 frames
> (frames 289-292)" was the **title-card fade itself** misidentified — at `shotEvery=4`, files 289-292 = game frames
> ~1156-1168 = exactly the title-card frames. Mechanism: `fadeToBlack=1` enables the map BG LAYERS, but the ch03 battle
> map isn't built until the BeginningScene's `LOMA` (runs AFTER the cutscene), so the layers are EMPTY → black, nothing
> to flash. Proof GIF `docs/demo/ch03-intro-noflash.gif` (`4acda80`). **RESIDUAL:** the real ch02→ch03 CHAIN isn't wired,
> so if that path pre-loads the cave map into VRAM before the intro it COULD flash (the debug boot can't exercise it) —
> **re-verify the intro when the chain lands.** The "Za'ha Woods" placeholder card is the separate title-card item.
> **CRIER GIF REGENERATED (`091254d`):** `docs/demo/ch03-opening.gif` now shows the committed crier textbox wrap fix
> (the bounty line wraps inside the bubble, no right-edge overflow) + the fixed Pinky staging. `make_gif.py` still writes
> only to `map-review/` — copy to `docs/demo/` + push to share (GitHub blob renders GIFs inline; mobile too).

> **Prior session (2026-07-10 #1, desktop→remote — Ch3 CUTSCENE POLISH pass on `feat/23-ch03-cutscenes`. Committed `1bd8e26`
> + pushed (NO PR yet).):**
> **BG SWAP FIXED** (the prior session's ⭐ blocker): `BACG` (`EventShowTextBgDirect`, eventscr.c:1316) only DECOMPRESSES
> a new BG when `proc->activeTextType` is `REMOVEPORTRAITS`/`_1A22`; the town `Text()` beats left it in `TEXTSTART`, so the
> 2nd `BACG(mine)` was a silent no-op (stale town stayed in VRAM). Fix = re-arm with `REMOVEPORTRAITS` before the 2nd BACG
> (the vanilla ch17a multi-BG idiom). Verified in-engine + Nicolas watched.
> **PREP MAP-FLASH FIXED (ch01/ch02/ch03):** dropped the `FADU`-reveal before `CALL(prep)` — the shared prep prologue
> (`EventScr_08591F64`) self-fades, so revealing the freshly-LOMA'd map first only flashed it. Now black→prep.
> **CRIER TEXT OVERFLOW FIXED:** faced scene beats render as talk BUBBLES (`_scenic_beat_calls`→`Text()`→PutTalkBubble,
> ≤29), NOT full-screen — a >29 line hits the unclamped `x = 29 - width < 0` branch and runs off the right edge. Fixed
> `_emit_scene_beats` faced default 42→29 (systemic). Box now bounded.
> **BGs (Nicolas iterated):** town `{Zeldacrafter}` source was 256×160 with cols 240-255 BLACK PADDING → old center-crop
> landed it as an 8px right strip; re-cropped to the real 240 content. Cave redone from the genuine FE7-native `Cave.png`
> (256×160, mine-mouth, NO LANCZOS/zoom/banding). THEN both zoomed **~7.7%** (center-crop 222×148→NEAREST 240×160) so
> content bleeds to all 4 edges — kills the ENGINE-rendered right-edge black (the asset+TSA were already full-width;
> the black was the rightmost display column). Verified in-game: town right cols 84-121 (non-black). `bg_to_fe8.py`
> LANCZOS→NEAREST. Cave = 4 banks/58 colours (within limits).
> **CAVE BATTLE PLATFORM FIXED:** the combat platform was default PURPLE (cave terrain unwired). Added a Cave ground array
> (`BanimTerrainGround_Tileset16`) mapping mine floor→vanilla `siroyuka1` STONE (value 21) / rock walls→`gake1` (5);
> `ch03 battleTileSet→0x16` (inject_battle_platforms). Verified stone in the grell battle.
> **TREX REPOSITIONED (10,6)→(2,4):** research CONFIRMED our `ch03-the-termalaine-mine.mar` is a **1:1 17×16 retile of
> vanilla Ch3 (Borgo)** (`Ch3Map.json`); green Colm spawns (0,5) → walks to standing tile **(2,4)** (`UnitDef_088B4718`/
> `REDA_088B456C`). Grell already matches Bazba at (14,1). Trex now stands green on Colm's ledge. `CH03_TREX_GREEN_POS=(2,4)`.
> **MOGALL DEATH QUOTE REMOVED** (Nicolas: faceless→unreadable): the grell's `gDefeatTalkList` entry `.msg = 0` — the win
> still fires (DisplayDefeatTalkForPid shows the quote only `if (ent->msg != 0)` but SetPidDefeatedFlag runs regardless,
> eventinfo.c:595). Silent DefeatBoss.
> **RECORDER + TOOLING:** new `recordch03talk` (green→Talk→blue + phase-cycle sprite refresh), `recordch03win` (battle
> anim + death + ending), `recordmapfull` (pan-grid full-map stitch, camera scroll @ gBmSt+0x0C). **`moveUnit` no-move
> confirm-A RETRY fix** — the confirm-A was eaten by the move-range anim when the cursor was already on the tile; this was
> the driver-pacing regression the prior handoff flagged. **`ch03prep`/`ch03talk`/`ch03win` all PASS again.** `make_gif.py`
> now has an **ffmpeg palettegen fast path** (>300 frames: 8 min → 2.7 s; the PIL delta+decode-check stalled). Record ~4×
> faster + lossless via `PT_FPS=240` (screenshots fire per game-frame regardless of wall-clock speed).
> **RESOLVED (not bugs):** Trex's red-caped map sprite = his recruited PC-blue palette (Nicolas confirmed appropriate);
> vanilla FE8 has **no "X joined" popup** (Colm recruit = TEXTSHOW→CUSA, verified) — an add would be non-vanilla.

> **`bootToMap` is now PREP-aware** (`driveThroughPrep` — Fight! when the Preparations proc is up, no-op otherwise),

> `ch03win` + `ch03talk` still PASS through the prep-aware boot. 100 unit tests + `make check` + verify_text green.
> Real flow: `docs/demo/ch03-prep-{menu,fielded}.png`. **Gotcha:** the two free repurposed Ch4 tables

> **Prior session (2026-07-09 #2, desktop — Ch3 Trex TALK-RECRUIT wired + verified; PR #150 MERGED):**
> **#23 item 2 DONE — Trex talk-recruit (the vanilla Colm/Neimi pattern).** Trex stands GREEN; **ANY core party

> **DECOUPLE (Nicolas):** Trex's entrance + recruit are split **OUT of** the RBG-execution cutscene. Colm's on-map
> appearance is a LIGHT green-NPC beat and ALL his substance rides the Talk — no second cutscene re-introduces him.
> So the ch03 **RBG-execution beat is now RBG's alone (+ Wolfram)**, and Trex's disavowal/boast/deal MOVED to the
> talk. **Why (the bug it fixes):** a freely-timed talk recruit + a fixed Brute-defeat cutscene fire in either
> order, so bolting Trex's intro onto the execution let a player who talked first recruit him *before* the cutscene
> "introduced" him. Talk line reframed to *"the wild ones — the ones your bounty names"* (accurate from turn 1,
> zero kills). ch03 YAML split into `trex_entrance` (light, Pinky telegraph + RBG "little dragon" — rides the

> **Trex iron-sword fix:** he had no YAML `inventory:`, so `difficulty.py` read "no weapon" and modeled him as a

> **Prior session (PRs #147 + #148, both SQUASH-MERGED):** #147 re-passed the ch03 opening + RBG-execution beats on

## Workflow — feature-flow
Issue → short-lived `feat/<slug>` branch off `main` → an ephemeral worktree → PR → CI + `/code-review`
→ squash-merge → drop the branch + worktree. No fixed lanes; a feature may span engine + content
(`decisions.md` → Coordination model). Hard invariants: no character/chapter/plot in `.c`/`.s`
(`check.py check_engine_campaign_agnostic`); never commit the `fireemblem8u` submodule pointer.
- **Drive integration end-to-end without asking** (Nicolas, re-emphasized 2026-06-29): cut the branch,
  commit, open the PR, watch CI, squash-merge — all unprompted. Keep branches **tidy** (one feature per
  branch; never mix unrelated WIP). Commit **tested, self-contained tooling slices on their own** the
  moment they're green — don't park finished infra in the working tree waiting on a downstream consumer.

> **Worktree friction (single-agent):** a fresh worktree's `fireemblem8u` submodule isn't provisioned
> (no `baserom.gba`, no built `scaninc`/toolchain) → builds die late. With no concurrent builds it's
> faster to work a feature branch **in the main tree** (already provisioned) than to set a worktree up.
>
> **BUT concurrent agents MUST each use their own worktree.** Separate branches alone do NOT isolate
> parallel work — the one shared working tree + index means a stray `git add -A`/commit from one agent
> sweeps the other's files into its commit (happened 2026-06-29: the #23 dialogue and #65 braulo work
> tangled on one tree; untangled with no loss, but costly). The main-tree shortcut holds ONLY for a
> single writer. Two agents at once → `git worktree add` per agent (worktree friction is acceptable for
> non-build edits like YAML/lore/docs; builds still need the submodule provisioned).

## Current release
**v0.1.0** friend release — Ch1 playable. Builds:
- `tools/build.sh dist` — **the friend build** (with the #43 opening montage), stamped into `dist/`.
- `tools/build.sh test` — lean dev build (straight-to-map boot).
- `make TESTCH=1` — Ch1 **sandbox** (whole cast + foes pre-deployed, New Game boots onto the map) for
  playtest **and battle-anim capture**. On macOS apply the shebang fix first (`build.sh` does it for
  test/dist; for a bare `make TESTCH=1`, re-run the `sed '1s|^#!/bin/python3|...'` loop from `build.sh`).

Versioning `v0.<chapters-playable>.<patch>` (`VERSION` file). **Never a bare `make` for a shippable
ROM** (the wrapper applies the decomp shebang fix; a bare `make` dies on the gfx tools on macOS).
ADR: `decisions.md` §Distribution.

## Tools (quick ref)
- `make difficulty CH=chNN` · `make difficulty-gate` (enforcing parity curve) · `make test` · `make check` (drift).
- **Battle-anim pipeline** (`tools/descale_battleframe.py`): hi-res poses → FE8-scale 64×56 frames
  (flip → uniform scale → shared feet anchor → sharpen → palette → 1px outline). **The per-unit recipe
  lives in the unit's YAML comment block** (e.g. `pcs/braulo.yaml` §Battle Animation:
  `--body 44 --sharpen 1.8 --thin-outline --flat "red:3,orange:3,grey:2,brown:3"`, with the source pose
  paths). **READ that comment before regenerating** — don't reconstruct flags from memory (cost a detour
  this session). `--flat` family palette is **crab-tuned** (warm hues: braulo); RBG (green/purple) uses
  adaptive (`--noflip --body 38`, no `--flat`).
- **`bg_to_fe8.py`** `<src-img> <out.png> [--fit crop|pad]` — any image → an FE8 event-BG source PNG
  (240×160, GBA-5bit, tile-banked mode-P, ≤8 banks; reserves transparent index 0). Feed to
  `inject_backgrounds`. Winter-BG catalogue: `map-review/iwd-bg-library.md`.
- **Map-sprite tooling (#38 art loop):** `tools/map_sprite_tool.py` (validate/`recolour`/`remap_sms_palette`/
  preview) · `tools/map_sprite_editor.py <sheet> <pal> --donor X [--mu]` (in-browser PIXEL editor) ·
  **`tools/map_sprite_swapper.py --trex` (NEW, PR #144)** — in-browser GLOBAL cast-index palette-swap UI
  (idle/walk independent sets, live preview, Apply-to-files). Enemy reskin = raw FE-Repo sprite → bg-index-0
  → `map_sprites/<sprite>.png`+`_mu.png` → `campaign.yaml enemy_class_reskins`; PC = recolour onto cast palette.
- **FE-Repo vendoring:** `gh api repos/Klokinator/FE-Repo/git/trees/main?recursive=1` is TRUNCATED — navigate
  via `contents/<dir>` then `curl` the `download_url` (never submodule the 2.3GB repo). Map sprites live under
  `Map Sprites/Infantry - (Axe) Brigs, Pirates, Zerkers/`.
- **Playtest scenarios** `tools/playtest/run.sh <scenario>` (need a built ROM + `lua`):
  - logic/stability: `win|gameover|ch01win|clear|clear_ch01|smoke|smoke_ch01|fuzz`
  - **ch3 (#23):** `PT_HOST_CHAPTER=4 run.sh mapshot` (map+units) · **`ch03prep`** (Preparations opens → Fight!
    fields 9 at the deploy_slots, Trex green) · **`ch03win`** (kill grell → assert `EVFLAG_DEFEAT_BOSS` → ending) ·
    **`ch03talk`** (Trex green→blue via Talk) · **`koboldview`** (pull off-camera enemies next to the party) — all on
    a `make CH03BOOT=1` ROM (macOS: apply the `build.sh` shebang-fix loop first). `bootToMap` drives through PREP.
  - **LLM commander (#63):** `llm` — needs the sidecar running (`llm_player.py serve`; see run.sh header).
  - **ch2 (#22):** `ch02` · `smoke_ch02` · `clear_ch02` (all load a `ch02start` checkpoint).
  - **Battle-anim capture:** `PT_CHAR=<id> tools/playtest/run.sh recordanim` on a `make TESTCH=1` ROM
    (New Game → straight to a forced battle for that unit) → `tools/playtest/make_gif.py recordanim <id>
    --name <id>-anim`. `recordrbg`/`recordlord` too.
  - **ch2 cutscene GIF scenarios live on the unmerged `demo/ch2-gifs` branch:** `recordch02{intro,map,combat,ending}`.
- **Delivery to Nicolas-on-mobile:** commit a **GIF or PNG** (never MP4) to `docs/demo/` + push → he views
  the GitHub blob URL (renders inline on phone). **`make_gif.py` only writes to `map-review/` (gitignored)**
  — to share, **copy the GIF to `docs/demo/` and commit**, or the blob stays stale. In-app file-send +
  `open` in Preview don't reach his phone.

## Now / Next

### Content — Party battle animations (#65 Milestone B) — 2 of 8 PCs done; **wolfram is next, art-blocked**
**RBG + braulo are DONE & merged** (RBG/braulo #94; braulo's revised Action2 peak #98). Pipeline is FE8's
per-CHARACTER `_u25` path — no class slot per unit (`inject_battle_anims` appends the unit's `AnimConf` to
`gUnitSpecificBanimConfigs[]`, sets `_u25`; `_patch_banim_character_unique` routes combat to
`GetBattleAnimationId_WithUnique`). Working templates: `pcs/{prof-rbg,braulo}.yaml` `battle_anim:` blocks.

#### ⭐ Wolfram (#65) — engine half MERGED, waiting on 3 art poses
The **Knight/lance donor tooling is merged & inert** (PR #99): `BANIM_DONORS['knight'] →
(CLASS_ARMOR_KNIGHT, ITYPE_LANCE, melee, 'lance')` + a `lance` `_MELEE_CADENCE` (heavy armored steps +
armored leap + thrust whoosh + screen shake, studied from vanilla `banim_armm_sp1`). Nothing uses it yet —
wolfram is **pure art-in → land** once 3 poses exist. Steps:
1. **Nicolas generates 3 Gemini poses** — edit-from-concept on ref `References/References/PCs/Wolfram full.png`
   (he's a **Mineralscale Drakeborn** — grey living-metal scales, tusks, beard+topknot, frost-crystal
   accents, **warhammer**; NOT a rat — that's RBG). Magenta `#FF00FF` bg. **Prompts:
   `lore/wolfram.md` → §Battle-anim prompt pack** (his RBG/braulo template + a *simplify-for-small-sprite* clause).
2. Drop the 3 PNGs anywhere (scratchpad) as `ready/windup/peak`.
3. **Then (Claude's part):** key magenta→alpha → `descale_battleframe.py` (try **adaptive** first — wolfram
   is neutral grey + cool crystals, *not* a `--flat` warm family; compare) → review the 64×56s → add the
   `battle_anim:` block to `pcs/wolfram.yaml` (`clone_from: knight`, `motion: melee`, `cadence: lance`,
   `abbr` ≤12, `frames: [ready,windup,peak]`; **record the descale recipe in a YAML comment**) →
   `make TESTCH=1` → `PT_CHAR=wolfram recordanim` → copy GIF to `docs/demo/` + push → **SHOW Nicolas** → land.

**Motion (3-beat lance fake):** ready = guard, hammer at rest · windup = coiled back, hammer overhead (held
longest, 20t) · peak = lunge & slam to full extension, held through `hit_normal` (engine adds the −40 forward
OAM lunge; feet stay anchored in the art). 3 frames is a hard cap (script refs frames 0/1/2).

#### The other 5 PCs + Trex (after wolfram) — donor mapping by class
pinky = Pegasus (lance flier — reuses the lance cadence) · marty + meesmickle = Shaman (dark caster) ·
rootis = Mage (anima caster) · sclorbo = Cleric (staff — may need a heal pose) · **trex = Thief but
reuses the **brigand Wildling** anim (Nicolas, 2026-07-08 — the ch03 kobold reskin, NOT myrmidon/thief);
ch03 recruit, added to #65**.
**meesmickle has a parked vendored Kitsune anim** at `battle_anims/_parked/`. Each: one `battle_anim:` block
+ 3 descaled frames, one feature-flow branch per unit (or small batch), `custom_unit` issue template.
- **Deferred polish (tracked):** braulo's white swing-arc weapon-trail → **#91**; goblin enemy class-level anim → **#90**.

### Content — Ch3 "The Termalaine Mine" (#23) — HOSTED + WIN + SPRITES + DIALOGUE + RECRUIT + PREP-DEPLOY + CUTSCENES-WIRED (⭐ WIP: opening BG-swap not rendering); midmap/chain/chests/title/art remain
Vanilla-FE8-Ch3 reskin as Termalaine's kobold-overrun tourmaline mine. Teaching goal = the **thief**
(Trex = our Colm). Decisions: `decisions.md` → Ch3 ADR (four deviations + **item 4 = Defeat Boss**) + the
ch03 YAML `design_notes` (2026-07-06 narrative reframe). **Live build checklist = #23 (the source of truth);
how-to for the host machinery = `docs/adding-a-chapter.md`.**
- **DONE:** map painted + hosted on slot 4; **DefeatBoss WIN + `ch03win`** (PR #143); **Trex bust** (PR #142);
  **ALL enemy map sprites in-engine** — Wildling grunts (PR #144) + **Lizardzerker blade skirmisher + steel
  brute** on appended classes 0x80/0x81 (PR #145, audited via `enemycheck`). archer + thief + grell VANILLA.
  **Recruit UNITS wired (PR #146, MERGED):** reusable data-driven
  recruit model (`decisions.md` → **Recruit wiring** ADR) — a recruit = a classed cast member + a
  `recruit.chapter`; `cast_available_at(N)` = founding + recruits recruited before N. **Trex** = real unit
  (Rennac slot, Colm donor) placed **GREEN** on the ch03 map (Colm-style talk recruit; joins via `CUSA` →
  cast OBJ palette). **Baxby** = promoted from cutscene-face to a real unit (Forde slot, Franz donor); his
  hand-painted axe-beak sprite injects on the standard **32×32 cast pattern** (`base: Gargoyle` GEOMETRY
  token + synth MU, like braulo/wolfram/meesmickle). Verified in-engine: **`ch03` scenario** PASS
  (`blue[08]=0x10` Baxby + `green Trex 0x1C @ (10,6)`); 55 tests + verify_text green. **Trex talker LOCKED =
  ANY core party member.** **Audit:** Lupin/Sahnar/Basil (ch04/ch05) are in the SAME "authored-YAML, no unit"
  state — wire each per its slice.
  **✅ DONE — cutscene recruits now PERSIST (2026-07-08, on PR #146):** off-map recruit join-LOAD wired.
  `build_campaign.offmap_join_recruits(N)` returns the recruits newly available at N that join off-map
  (`recruit.via` not `story`/`talk`); `inject_ch02` LOADs them (Baxby) on a free vanilla-Ch3 UnitDef symbol
  (`088B476C`), blue, before the PREP CALL → he enters the saved party. **Empirically verified in-engine:**
  `tools/playtest/run.sh ch02baxby` PASS — Baxby at `blue[8]=0x10` in the prep roster AND deployable +
  fighting on the ch02 map (killed a raider in melee). Existing `ch02` scenario still PASS (deploy cap 5).
  3 new unit tests (58 total green). Talk recruits (Trex) still self-join via `CUSA`.
- **DONE (PR #150, MERGED):** ✅ **item 2 — Trex TALK-RECRUIT** (green→blue via `CUSA`; talker =
  any core party member; verified in-engine `ch03talk`) + the **decouple** (entrance/execution split; Trex's
  substance moved to the Talk) + the **Trex iron-sword** difficulty fix.
  Also DONE (PR #147): **Ch3 DIALOGUE LOCKED** — the 3 cutscene beats' text lives in the ch03 YAML `script:` blocks.
- **DONE (PR #151, MERGED):** ✅ **item 3 — Real PREP deploy.** The ch03 party picks in via **Preparations** (the
  vanilla ch01/ch02 flow), replacing the weaponless static fast-boot. `deployment.deploy_slots` (9 tiles);
  `UnitDef_Event_Ch4Ally` = never-LOADed deploy-cap template; **PREP CALL** fields the roster (lord force-deployed,
  party ARMED from `CLASS_LOADOUT`). Trex moved to his own green table (`UnitDef_088B49CC`); `--ch03-boot` LOADs an
  armed seed (`UnitDef_088B47E4`); new `inject_ch03(boot=)` param (chaining pass omits the seed). `bootToMap` is
  PREP-aware. Verified: `ch03prep` PASS; flow in `docs/demo/ch03-prep-{menu,fielded}.png`.
- **CUTSCENES — largely DONE (branch `feat/23-ch03-cutscenes` @ `1bd8e26`, pushed, NO PR yet):**
  ✅ opening / Trex turn-1 entrance / ending wired + rendering; ✅ Wolfram/narration width fix; ✅ BG-append infra.
  ✅ **town→mine BG SWAP FIXED** (REMOVEPORTRAITS re-arm before the 2nd BACG — see top block). ✅ **prep map-flash fixed**
  (ch01/ch02/ch03). ✅ **crier text overflow fixed** (faced beats wrap 29). ✅ **BGs** (town de-padded + both zoomed ~7.7%,
  right-edge black gone; cave = FE7-native mine-mouth). ✅ **cave battle platform** (siroyuka1 stone). ✅ **Trex→(2,4)**
  (Colm's tile). ✅ **mogall death quote removed** (silent win). ✅ **drivers un-regressed** (`moveUnit` retry;
  `ch03prep`/`ch03talk`/`ch03win` PASS). ✅ recorders (`recordch03talk`/`win`/`mapfull`) + `make_gif` ffmpeg fast path.
  ⛔ **STILL OPEN (fresh instance):** (1) the **opening MAP FLASH** (chapter-intro reveals the map ~4 frames before the
  town BACG; `fadeToBlack` did NOT fix it — needs an engine hook or bundle with title-card #4); (2) **Pinky-scout staging**
  (only Pinky fades, RBG stays — needs `FACE_SHOW`). Full detail in the top session block.
- **REMAINING (unchecked on #23):**
  1. **⭐ NEXT — the OPENING MAP FLASH + Pinky-scout staging** (the two ⛔ above), then the **midmap RBG-EXECUTION beat**
     (RBG guns down the beaten Brute + Wolfram's ore gag — **Nicolas confirmed KEEP it**, RBG-only, Trex-free). Midmap needs
     a Brute-**miniboss unique pid** (like the grell's 0xb7, not the shared 0xaa) + a **flagged-defeat AFEV** trigger
     (`AFEV(trigger, midmap_script, tmp_flag)` fired by a gDefeatTalkList entry on the Brute's death — mirror the
     grell's DefeatBoss wiring) + a kobold-brute mug (or faceless like the grell). Msg ids reserved 0x9AF–0x9B1.
  2. **Chain ch02→ch03** — point ch02's ending `MNC2(0x4)` at ch03 (drop the ch02 dev-placeholder landing); replace
     the ch03 minimal DefeatBoss ending with the real ending cutscene once ch04 hosts (or park like ch02 until then).
     **When this lands, drop the `--ch03-boot` armed party seed** — call `inject_ch03(boot=False)` in the real chain
     so the persistent ch02 party feeds PREP (the `boot=` param + the seed table are already in place for this).
  3. **Chests/doors** — per-chest **`17→29` TILECHANGE**; Trex opens, key-droppers back up.
  4. **Title-card** (replace the vanilla slot-4 **"Za'ha Woods"** placeholder that shows at chapter start) — **couple this
     with the opening map-flash fix** (both are the same `gProcScr_ChapterIntro` sequence). + full load-test scenarios
     `ch03`/`smoke_ch03`/`clear_ch03` (the `ch03prep`/`ch03win`/`ch03talk`/`koboldview`/`enemycheck` scenarios seed these;
     a fair-play `clear_ch03` needs a `CA_BOSS` grell or a pid-targeted bot).
  - **Optional polish:** the recruit talk renders in the **map speech bubble** (no portrait box), canonical for
    on-map CHAR talks — switch to the full portrait box if Nicolas wants Trex's bust to show on recruit.
- **Cutscene BGs (updated 2026-07-10):** real BGs vendored/authored — `bg_TargosWinter` (town, {Zeldacrafter}, de-padded +
  zoomed) + `bg_TermalaineMine` (cave, FE7-native, zoomed). `bg_to_fe8.py` uses NEAREST + a slight zoom so content bleeds
  to all edges (no engine right-edge black). mid-map beats stay on-map.
- Then chapters #24–#28 follow the same slice via `docs/adding-a-chapter.md`.

### Content — Ch2 (#22) — DONE / CLOSED (2026-06-26)
All slice items merged (#85 card, #88 Targos BG + name-leak fix); #22 closed. Non-gating leftover: the demo
reel on the unmerged `demo/ch2-gifs` branch is stale vs the merged fixes — regenerate-vs-drop as a standalone
demo-asset task (ships nothing; v0.1.0 is Ch1-only). Scratch review images live on `review/ch02-ending-bg`
(not for merge).

### Parked / supporting
- Enemy/NPC art/anim → convention homes (`inject_battle_anims`/`inject_battle_platforms` docstrings +
  `decisions.md` Art & Audio + `custom_unit` template); one issue per unit.
- Supporting backlog: enemy YAML #18 · NPC stubs #17 · world-map #29 · overworld sprites #38 ·
  onboarding-parity #64 · faked battle anims epic #65.

### Pipeline — playtest / parity
- **Clear-bot #60 — code complete (PR #116), needs a local `clear_ch01` mGBA confirm to close.**
  `pickMove` march core (field-first, claimed-tile avoidance, cork-jam fallback) + the root-cause fix:
  `selectAndReach`'s default 15×10 window clipped ch01 reach at x=14 — bounds now threaded.
- **LLM-player #63 — M1+M2 landed (PR #118), M3 next.** Sidecar file-handshake + `llm` scenario +
  provider-agnostic policy (`PT_PROVIDER=openai` + local Ollama = free Llama/Gemma; anthropic/Sonnet
  default per the epic). First local run: sidecar `--record` to mint `transcripts/prologue.json`, then
  replay is free forever. M3 = staff driving + multi-target disambiguation → M4 soak→curve → M5 vanilla-FE8.
- **`balance_locked: true` is LIVE on ch00/ch01/ch02** — the per-chapter parity gate (#48b,
  `make difficulty-gate`, in CI) actively enforces all three; new chapters opt in as their enemy
  inventories are authored and playtested.
- #53 tail (FE8 Ch13 → our ch08): ~11 standard weapons, informational. Former leaves settled 2026-07-02:
  d20 crit #11 ✓ · iconic matchups #8 **reverted + closed not-planned** (vanilla principle covers item
  data; flavor only) · spell-economy #9 = vanilla behavior incl. break-and-rebuy (content lands per-chapter).
